- title: 'Populate .gitignore Automatically with git-ignore'
  preamble: |
    Tired of having to create your `.gitignore` manually?
    Like, having to add `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `*.swp`, `*.swo`, `*.swn`, `node_modules`?

    I stumbled upon this project called [git-ignore](https://github.com/imwithye/git-ignore).

    I like to teach my friends about coding stuff, usually about the web, JavaScript, Ruby, and sometimes other things.
    When I do, I like to find new ways to help people see what actually happened. Anyway, this post isn’t about me; it’s about Angular.js. I used it to create an [array visualizer](http://plnkr.co/edit/gist:6743484?p=preview) to help visualize how sorting algorithms work, within 15 minutes.
