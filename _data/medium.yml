- title: 'Declaring a CSS Animation @keyframes Directly on an Element using Sass'
  preamble: |
    Usually, when I write CSS (or Sass), making an element animate involves
    creating an `@keyframe` declaration and giving it a name,
    and referencing it in the CSS ruleset by name.

    More often than not, that particular animation would have been used only once in your whole CSS file.
    This article introduces a mixin to help.

- title: 'Changing the System Font on Yosemite'
  preamble: |
    Mac OS X comes with a new system font, Helvetica Neue.
    Maybe it’s just me, but for such a new and modern interface, Helvetica Neue feels… ancient, and Helvetica is already everywhere…

    A more futuristic font such as Avenir Next may be a better choice.

- title: 'Populate .gitignore Automatically with git-ignore'
  preamble: |
    Tired of having to create your `.gitignore` manually?
    Like, having to add `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `*.swp`, `*.swo`, `*.swn`, `node_modules`?

    I stumbled upon this project called [git-ignore](https://github.com/imwithye/git-ignore).

    I like to teach my friends about coding stuff, usually about the web, JavaScript, Ruby, and sometimes other things.
    When I do, I like to find new ways to help people see what actually happened. Anyway, this post isn’t about me; it’s about Angular.js. I used it to create an [array visualizer](http://plnkr.co/edit/gist:6743484?p=preview) to help visualize how sorting algorithms work, within 15 minutes.
