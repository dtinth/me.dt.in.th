  <i>(This is a response to [Straight-line code over functions — FunFunFunction #3](https://medium.com/humans-create-software/straight-line-code-over-functions-funfunfunction-3-7f845cd79af4))</i>

  I sometimes prefer to write a single, straight-line functions
  rather than writing a function that calls many small
  closely-related functions, especially in imperative code.

  But when a function starts to get longer than 15 lines, I start feeling that the code becomes less readable.

  <mark>One of the pattern I found very useful when writing JavaScript code is to write functions in functions.</mark>
