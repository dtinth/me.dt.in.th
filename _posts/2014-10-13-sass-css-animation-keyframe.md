title: 'Declaring a CSS Animation @keyframes Directly on an Element using Sass'
preamble: |
  Usually, when I write CSS (or Sass), making an element animate involves

  and referencing it in the CSS ruleset by name.

  More often than not, that particular animation would have been used only once in your whole CSS file.
