<p>So we're doing some programming tasks at the computer olympics camp. My friend has got the task descriptions and all the testcases for the last year's competitions.</p>

<p>Now that everyone has finished their codes, we need to grade them and see if....</p>

<ul>
<li>The output is correct.</li>
<li>The code runs in time.</li>
<li>The code uses not much memory (but I don't know how to check it, so skip it :D)</li>
</ul>

<p>But I don't have a grader so I came up with this real quick.</p>

<p>So there you have it. Read the code to know how to use it.</p>
