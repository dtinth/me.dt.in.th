  So I’m sleepy, but want to make sure that I wake up on time.

  For numerous times, my phone’s alarm clocks failed me. Some morning I wake up late with a notification, saying ‘missed alarm.’ My iPad, too. It would play the alarm song once before going completely silent.

  In this episode, I created a simple alarm clock in shell script that tells iTunes to start playing songs after a certain period of time passes.
