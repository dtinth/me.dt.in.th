title: 'Changing the System Font on Yosemite'
preamble: |
  Mac OS X comes with a new system font, Helvetica Neue.
  Maybe it’s just me, but for such a new and modern interface, Helvetica Neue feels… ancient, and Helvetica is already everywhere…

  A more futuristic font such as Avenir Next may be a better choice.
