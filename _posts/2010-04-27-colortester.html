<p>I'm customizing my text editor's syntax highlighter.</p>

<p>Usually I start by opening the text editor's option, pick a syntax item and then pick a random color. Apply and see if it looks nice. But then I realize that it doesn't work very well.</p>

<p>Why? Because there are no plans for what part of a syntax (number, strings, statements) belongs to what color.</p>

<p>So I need to plan all the color first before I can actually use it in a text editor. So I came up with this.</p>

<p

<p>So to use it, type in some color codes. The first color will be displayed as a background, and the rest will be displayed as text. Still don't get it? Here's a sample. If I typed</p>

<pre><code>#ffffff
#10a520
#aab512
#984151
</code></pre>

<p
class="center" >The result will look like this:</p>

<p
class="center" >You can also include some text too to describe the color. So here is my color scheme.</p>

<pre><code>#232323
#dadada for normal text
#80ceff for preprocessors
#80ef50 for comments
#d0f979 for characters
#f9f979 for strings
#ecb760 for keywords
#f08686 for numbers
</code></pre>

<p
class="center" >And here's how it looks like.</p>

<p class="oldblog-image"><img src="http://tnk.dt.in.th/blog-data/2010-04/27-2233.png" alt=""></p>

<p
class="center" >Putting it in my favorite text editor, it now looks like this.</p>

<p class="oldblog-image"><img src="http://tnk.dt.in.th/blog-data/2010-04/27-2237.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Maybe I will use this scheme for all other codes that I may post on this blog too.</p>

<p>And oh, I came up with this color scheme because I have bought a black (in fact, it's dark gray) notebook from Japan. All the pages are in dark gray and they need special pens to write on it. So I played with these colored pens and black papers and came up with this color scheme.</p>

<p>With this color scheme, codes will have hot colors, so yellow for strings, red for numbers and orange for keywords. Comments and pre&shy;processors have colder colors so they stand out.</p>

<p>So that's it, hope you like it.</p>

<p>By the way I'm going to a computer olympics camp tomorrow, so I may post some C stuff here lol.</p>
