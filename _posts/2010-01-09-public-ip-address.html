<p>My ADSL USB MODEM that is connected directly to my server is broken. Now I need to use a router instead.</p>

<p>However, I can't get noip2 to find my public IP Address, but there is noip2 -i (your ip address).</p>

<p>So here is my solution:</p>

<p>Whenever you want to use your public IP address, just type:</p>

<pre><code>`curl http://ip.appspot.com/`
</code></pre>

<p>And that's it, so my noip2 command would be like:</p>

<pre><code>sudo noip2 -i `curl http://ip.appspot.com/`
</code></pre>
