title: "Quick and Dirty Real-time Collaborative Coding Development Environment with code.stypi.com"
layout: post
preamble: |
  I have to work on a very small C++ project with my friends,
  so I want to edit my code like Google Docs.

  [code.stypi.com](https://code.stypi.com/) provides a real-time collaborative code editor,
  like Etherpad or Google Docs, but it only supports editing a single file.
  So some quick and dirty script must be used to enable quick development and testing cycle.
---

The Nature of the Project
-------------------------

Of course, this approach does not apply in all projects,
so here's some background on the project.

* It's only a small group assignment. We don't need permanent storage; just a way to collaborate.
* It consists of only a few C++ source files, no images or binary files.
* I develop on Linux while my friends use Windows.
* It's a group assignment for the real-time systems engineering course.
  We have to create simulation using [OMNeT++](http://www.omnetpp.org/).

Let's consider the alternatives first, and why we did not use it

### Dropbox / Google Drive

* No real-time editing. Must save the file in order for it to synchronize.
* When we edit the same file, Dropbox just marks it as conflict and adds conflicted versions to the Dropbox.
* Binaries (for different platforms) gets added to the Dropbox and synchronized all over. No way to ignore certain files.


### GitHub

* Not real-time.
* Too slow cycle: have to save, commit, push, pull, merge.


### Nitrous.io / Cloud9 / Koding

* Creating a full-fledged project with a virtual machine and getting my friends to create an account
  on sites like [Nitrous.io](http://nitrous.io/), [Cloud9](http://c9.io/) or [Koding](https://koding.com/)
  just for a quick bootstrapping of a project seems to be an overkill.
* I want something more lightweight.
* Cloud9's collaboration feature is too laggy.
* Koding is too buggy (as of writing).


### Etherpad

* No syntax highlighting.

How about Stypi?
----------------

[code.stypi.com](https://code.stypi.com/) is a real-time collaboration platform.

* It lets you collaborate on writing code. It is usually used for online interviewing.
* It supports syntax highlighting and has a configurable tab size.
* You don't have to sign in; you can work anonymously.
* It also allows you to access the raw contents. So you can quickly download the code and build them with a quick and dirty script.


The Workflow
------------

1. Collaborate the code on Stypi.
2. Run a script to download the code from Stypi, builds, and test it.
3. Repeat.

Seems simple, right?



Overcoming Single File Limitation
---------------------------------

Since Stypi does not have tabs or support multiple files,
we decided to work on a single page, and then let the build script split it into multiple files.
The convention used is this:

```cpp
/*FILE file1.h*/
(contents of file1.h)

/*FILE file1.cc*/
(contents of file1.cc)

/*FILE main.cc*/
#include "file1.h"
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  stuff();
  return 0;
}
```



Getting the Raw Link
--------------------

If your Stypi is here:

```
https://code.stypi.com/lg1ervbj
```

You can access the raw contents using this URL:

```
https://code.stypi.com/raw/lg1ervbj
```



The Download Script
-------------------

First, I want a script that fetches the code from Stypi and spit out to multiple files.

So I put this into Stypi:

```ruby
/*FILE download.rb*/
require 'open-uri'

puts "Downloading File:"

code = open('https://code.stypi.com/raw/lg1ervbj').read
code.split(/\/\*FILE ([a-z0-9]+\.[a-z0-9]+)\*\//i).drop(1).each_slice(2) do |file_name, contents|
  puts " ==> #{file_name}"
  File.write(file_name, contents)
end
```

It simply fetches the code, and uses a regular expression to split it into many files.

Here's how it now looks like:

<div class="next-image-caption"></div>

This Stypi page contains the code for many files.
Each file is identified by a special comment.



Bootstrapping
-------------

Next thing, I have to tell my friends to download and install Ruby, MingW and MSYS.
Then, I tell them to manually copy the code for `download.rb` into a new file in a new directory,
and then run `ruby download.rb`.

If all goes well, all files should be downloaded:

<div class="next-image-caption next-image-caption-up"></div>

![After running ruby download.rb](/images/Stypi-Result.png)

After running `ruby download.rb`, all files (including download.rb itself) have been download.



Building
--------

Since the download script is finished, we can now make a build script!

```bash
/*FILE build.sh*/
set -e
g++ file1.cc main.cc

/*FILE test.sh*/
set -e
if [ -e a.out ]; then
  ./a.out
else
  ./a.exe
fi

/*FILE run.sh*/
set -e
ruby download.rb
bash build.sh
bash test.sh
```

Three files:

* `build.sh` compiles the source code.
* `test.sh` runs the compiled code.
* `run.sh` re-downloads the code, compiles, and runs.

I then told my friends to run `ruby download.sh` again.
It now downloads the required build script.

They can now type `bash run.sh` to re-download the code, compile, and run it.


Enjoy the Collaboration
-----------------------

Now we can enjoy collaborating on this small project.
When we make a change, we can just type `bash run.sh` to test it.
