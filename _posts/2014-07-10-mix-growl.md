  Every week, I listen to Uplifting Only on SoundCloud. It is a two-hour mix of Orchestral Uplifting and Uplifting Trance music.

  Recently, I have been able to get this SoundCloud feed into iTunes. I want to create a script that notifies me when the song changes, so I donâ€™t have to manually check for the playing song in iTunes.
