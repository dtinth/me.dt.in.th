preamble: |
  [ttycast](https://github.com/dtinth/ttycast) v0.2.0 is just released.
  This new version is easier to use, includes server-side terminal emulation (instead of client-side),
  configurable terminal size, and recording support to `.tty` file.
---





UI refinements
--------------

The terminal window is moved to the center of browser window, and is accompanied with
a little glow around the border.

Server-side terminal emulation
------------------------------

In old version (v0.0.x) raw terminal data is sent directly to each client, and each client runs its own
terminal emulator.

In this version the terminal emulation is done in server-side. The rendered content is then sent to the browser.
This ensures that all viewers see the same thing. The client side code to download is a lot smaller too.


Easier to use
-------------

You don't have to type long commands (`mkfifo /tmp/......`) to start ttycast anymore.

In this new version, just type `ttyreccast` in one terminal and `ttyrec /tmp/ttycast` in another.

Recording
---------

The new `ttyreccast` command also support recording to __.tty__ file as you broadcast.

You may play the recorded file normally using `ttyplay`.


Adjustable Terminal Size
------------------------

This version of ttycast doesn't require you to use 80x25 terminal anymore.

You can use any terminal size you want.
