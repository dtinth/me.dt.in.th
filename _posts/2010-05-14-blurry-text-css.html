<p
class="center" >This is an effect I have been using in a hidden feature of #thaiWitter, where a text pops up, and then blurs and fades away.</p>

<p
class="center" >I will show you how it looks like:</p>

<p
style="color:#fff;color:rgba(255,255,255,0);text-shadow:0 0 10px #fff;text-align:center" ><span style="font-size:4em;">Hello, World!</span></p>

<p>This effect can be achieved using CSS3. By setting the text to transparent and give it a text shadow. However this won't work on WebKit, because on WebKit browsers, if a text is transparent, then its shadow is transparent too, so in the example above you see nothing. Don't know how it looks like on Opera because I don't care. Anyway here's the code:</p>

<pre><code>color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);
text-shadow: 0 0 10px #fff;
</code></pre>

<p>Oh and for IE, just use <code>progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Blur</code> then. In fact it works for images too, not just text.</p>
