preamble: |
  I’m working as a TA for a university course (Software Specification and Design), and I’m creating a GitHub organization for students to submit assignments.

  The problem is getting all students into this organization.

  In this episode, I created a simple web site where students can enter their GitHub username and have an invite automatically send to them.
