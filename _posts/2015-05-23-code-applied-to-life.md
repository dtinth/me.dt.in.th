preamble: |
  I created a publication on Medium called “Code, Applied to Life” because I want to inspire people to get more excited about code. I want to show how a small piece of code (or shell script) can make your life easier.

  This publication is looking for writers. Let’s tell the world how you use code to solve everyday problems. Please contact me if you want to help contribute to this collection!
