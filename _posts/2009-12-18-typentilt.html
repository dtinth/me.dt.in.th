<p>I made something long time ago since I heard the news about accelerometer support in Firefox 3.6.</p>

<p>I use a MacBook and MacBooks has accelerometer built in, so I made this. I call it Typentilt, which comes from from Type and Tilt!</p>

<p><del>To use it just open it in Firefox 3.6 beta 4 or later, type some text in and then rotate your MacBook vertically. The text you type appears, filling the browser. It's best to use this in Full Screen! (Cmd+Shift+F in Firefox 3.6)</del></p>

<p><del><strong>Download</strong>: typentilt.zip</del></p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Update 2012-06-23</strong>: The MozOrientation is now the standard called "DeviceOrientation" API. And while Firefox claims that it's working, as of writing it doesn't. You should try it on Google Chrome, instead.</p>

<p>I also moved the files to GitHub: <a href="http://dtinth.github.com/typentilt/">http://dtinth.github.com/typentilt/</a></p>
