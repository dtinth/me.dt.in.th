  This is my new static site generator system,
  inspired by [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), but is written in Node.js.
  The name stands for 
  Static <em>S</em>ite <em>G</em>enerator using <em>V</em>iews and <em>C</em>ontents.
  It aims to be extremely flexible.

Before that, this website is running on a Ruby on Rails application,
but I think that Ruby on Rails is too complex for this kind of simple blog,
so I think writing a static site generator is better.




Features
--------

* Each post is a single text file, which corresponds to a single file.
* Write posts using a combination of Markdown and HTML. You can switch back and forth between Markdown and HTML using a special syntax.
* Each post can define its own CSS and JavaScript, so each blog post can be different.
* Each post can define parameters, which then can be understood by the layout.
    * For example, each post has to define a title, which the blog engine will then use to display on the list.
    * Each post can also define custom parameters, such as the "comments" parameter, and the layout can decide by this parameter whether to
      display the Disqus comment box or whatever.
* The index page is a single page which displays all of the posts.
* Each post can also have a preamble (Markdown only), which will be displayed on the index page.
