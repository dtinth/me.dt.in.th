<p>I am at school and I want to sign in to Facebook chat from my mobile phone. It is a Nokia 5630. I downloaded <strong>eBuddy Mobile</strong> from the Ovi Store, but as soon as I sign in to Facebook, it says "wrong username/password."</p>

<p
class="center" >So I opened up Opera Mobile to sign in to Facebook, but it says:</p>

<p class="oldblog-image"><img src="http://tnk.dt.in.th/blog-data/2010-06/18-1243.png" alt=""></p>

<p>So maybe it's eBuddy's server accessing my Facebook account, so I just continue. The next step is pretty easy: confirm using my mobile phone.</p>

<p

<p

<p>That looks very fun and exciting. I mean, it is just like a game. If I can remember people's face correctly then I can get my account back. So I pressed Start and then Facebook starts showing me pictures of my friends:</p>

<p class="oldblog-image"><img src="http://tnk.dt.in.th/blog-data/2010-06/18-1252.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Well, A Technika screen? I never have a friend as a Technika screen. I have seen many Technika screens before and they all look the same. I don't even know their name, so who could this be? I have no other choices. I need to skip this question to get my Facebook account back.</p>

<p class="oldblog-image"><img src="http://tnk.dt.in.th/blog-data/2010-06/18-2010.png" alt=""></p>

<p
class="center" >Now a Facebook logo? Seriously what the fuck is this? I only have 2 skips, and again, I need to use it.</p>

<p
class="center" >Then I see a photo where I can recognize the face, but...</p>

<p class="oldblog-image"><img src="http://tnk.dt.in.th/blog-data/2010-06/18-2104.png" alt=""></p>

<p
class="center" >....but look at these names! How can I know which name to choose? I also run out of skips. So I failed the tests, however, it's good that I have unlimited retries. Just sign out and sign in again.</p>

<p>I keep retrying until I can get pass through it. It appears that eBuddy's server accessed my account and Facebook never see me using eBuddy, so Facebook locked my account.</p>

<p>Now that my account was unlocked, I tried again, and then access to my account is blocked again and I have to through all the steps again. I forgot that eBuddy have many servers around the world. When I sign in the second time, it is from another server. I will never try it again. I will just stick with Nimbuzz. :D</p>

<p>Total time wasted: <strong>around 2 hours</strong>.</p>

<p>From my experience with Facebook, combined with what happened to me today, <strong>I see these things very annoying on Facebook</strong>:</p>

<h2>Tagging People Who Has Nothing To Do With A Photo</h2>

<p>I <strong>always</strong> remove my tag from photos that I am not in. I recommend that you do it too.</p>

<p>Usually when people want to share a photo with their friends, they tag their friends in this photo. To me it seems not right. I think that it's best to tag people in a photo if he/she is <strong>actually in the photo.</strong></p>

<p>So how to share your photo with your friends? I think that the best way to use the share feature in Facebook. To share it with all your friends, just click "share" on the sidebar and post it to profile.</p>

<p>Want to share it with only a number of friends? Click "share" on the sidebar, and then click on "send as a message instead." You can then choose who to send to.</p>

<h2>Using An Alias For Their Name On Facebook</h2>

<p>Most of the time I will <strong>never</strong> accept friend requests from people who don't use a real name. This is just my personal opinion. I am just annoyed.</p>

<p>On Windows Live Messenger, I can assign a personal alias to their contacts on their contact list, so I will know who is who. However on Facebook I can't.</p>

<p>To me, Facebook is different from other social networks. Unlike Twitter or Windows Live Messenger, I think that Facebook is where I can get in touch with people I already know and I will only be friends with people I already know. For Twitter and Windows Live Messenger that I use to chat and meet random people.</p>

<p>So... that's all for this blog post.</p>
