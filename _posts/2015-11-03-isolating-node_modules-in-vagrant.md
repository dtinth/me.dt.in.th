title: Isolating `node_modules` in Vagrant

preamble: |
  Iâ€™m playing with [Otto](https://ottoproject.io/)
  to set up a development environment for my Node.js project.

  The problem comes when I try to `npm install` inside the VM.
  Lots of weird errors going on.
  The `/vagrant` folder is shared between my Mac and my virtual machine.
  __By extension, this means the `node_modules` are shared as well.__

  `npm install` seems to cause a lot of crazy disk I/O on the shared folder,
  causing gibberish bytes to be written in some files, causing installation failure.

  The solution is to isolate that folder, so that the `node_modules` folder
  lives in the VM instead of shared between guest and host.
