title: 'With Angular.js I Created a Teaching Material in 15 minutes'
preamble: |
  > Just as iron sharpens iron, friends sharpen the minds of each other. —Proverbs 27:17 (CEV)

  I like to teach my friends about coding stuff, usually about the web, JavaScript, Ruby, and sometimes other things.
  When I do, I like to find new ways to help people see what actually happened. Anyway, this post isn’t about me; it’s about Angular.js. I used it to create an [array visualizer](http://plnkr.co/edit/gist:6743484?p=preview) to help visualize how sorting algorithms work, within 15 minutes.
