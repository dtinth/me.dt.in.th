  I am doing an internship at Nara Institute of Science and Technology for 2 months. During my time here, I traveled a lot and took many photos, and uploaded them to Facebook.

  The problem is that when there are so many photos in a single album, performance degrades, so I want to split them into many albums, while interlinking them together.

  One approach to do this is by putting links in the description of each album, linking to the other albums.
