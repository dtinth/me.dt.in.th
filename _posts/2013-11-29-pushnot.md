<p class="caption">When I push my code, the post-receive hook deploys it,
and pushes the notification back to my screen.</p>



Background
----------
When I push code to my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dtinth/dark-facebook),
GitHub triggers a [Post-Receive WebHook](https://help.github.com/articles/post-receive-hooks) that I set up to compile the code and deploy it.

I want to be notified when the code is successfully deployed.

Apple already has [Safari Push Notifications](https://developer.apple.com/notifications/safari-push-notifications/),
but [to use it](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/NotificationProgrammingGuideForWebsites/PushNotifications/PushNotifications.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40013225-CH3-SW1),
I need to be in their Mac Developer or iOS Developer program.

So I decided to roll my own.


Features
--------

* Send push notifications from your shell scripts, PHP scripts, or whatever.
* Notifications are encrypted using public key.


Overview
--------

<p class="image"><img src="/images/pushnot.png" alt="Overview Diagram"></p>
<p class="caption">The client sends a notification to the server.
The server pushes it to the subscriber.<br>
The subscriber displays the notification on screen.</p>

Pushnot consists of three major components:

* __The server__ that clients can send a notification to, and subscribers can subscribe to these notifications.
* __The client__ is any application that wants to send a notification to the user.
* __The subscriber__ waits for the server to push the notification and notifys the user.




Prerequisites
-------------
First, you need to have a private server to run your personal notification server.
I'm using [DigitalOcean's VPS](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
which costs only $5 a month. Installing [Node.js on it is straightforward](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-install-node-js-with-nvm-node-version-manager-on-a-vps).

On both your personal computer and the server, install:

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* [zeromq](http://zeromq.org/)
  * On Ubuntu, `apt-get install libzmq-dev` should do it.
  * On Mac OS X, perhaps using Homebrew.

On your personal computer, install and run:

* [Growl](http://growl.info/)
* [GrowlNotify](http://growl.info/downloads)
* [zephyros](https://github.com/sdegutis/zephyros)


Public and Private Key Generation
---------------------------------
All notifications are encrypted using a public key,
and only the user (with the private key) can see that notification.

`pushnot` requires an RSA key of at least 2048 bit:

```bash
openssl genrsa -out ~/.pushnot.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in ~/.pushnot.pem -pubout > ~/.pushnot.pub
```


Configuration
-------------
You need a configuration file to locate the server.

```json
cat > ~/.pushnot.conf.json
{ "server": "your.vps.host", "http": 60001, "zmq": 60002, "key": "some random string" }
```

* __server__: This is the IP address or host name of your server.
* __http__: The port of the HTTP server. You can use 60001.
* __zmq__: The port of the ZeroMQ server. You can use 60002.
* __key__: Enter some random string here, which is a shared key to communicate between the client and server.



Server Installation
-------------------

On server, install [pm2](http://pm2.io/).

```bash
npm install -g pm2 --unsafe-perm
```

Copy `~/.pushnot.conf.json` and `~/.pushnot.pub` to your server.

Clone the project and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dtinth/pushnot.git
cd pushnot
npm install
```

Link so that you can use the command `pushnot` anywhere.

```bash
npm link
```

Start the server:

```bash
pm2 start pushnot-server.js
```


Client Installation
-------------------

Also clone the project, and install dependencies.
You can link so that you can send push notifications from your computer too.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dtinth/pushnot.git
cd pushnot
npm install
npm link
```

Make sure both Zephyros and Growl is running,
start the subscriber!

```bash
node pushnot-subscriber.js
```

Let's send a push notification!
From the server,
run:

```bash
pushnot hello Hello World
```

You should now see the notification on your computer.

<p class="image"><img src="/images/pushnot-Screenshot.png" alt="The Notification"></p>
<p class="caption move-caption-up">Here comes the notification.</p>



Turn off Growl Display
----------------------

You should probably see that the notification is displayed both by Zephyros and Growl.

The reason for that is because I like Zephyros' alert boxes better (you can click through it), but I also want Growl to put the notification in "Growl Notification Rollup" when I am idle.

But displaying two notifications at once seems like a silly idea. That's why I tell Growl not to display a notification by setting the display style to "No Default Display"

<p class="image"><img src="/images/pushnot-NoDefaultDisplay.png" alt="Growl Settings"></p>
<p class="caption move-caption-up">Set the Application's Display Style for pushnot to "No Default Display."</p>




Use pushnot in Your Hooks
-------------------------

Now you are free to use `pushnot` in your post-commit hooks.
For example,
if you just want to notify when someone pushes a commit to your repository,
you can use this hook (written in PHP):

```php
<?php

function truncate($text) {
  $text = trim(preg_replace('~\n.*$~s', '', $text));
  return strlen($text) > 80 ? substr($text, 0, 80) . '...' : $text;
}

$payload = json_decode($_POST['payload']);

$app = $payload->repository->owner->name . ' / ' . $payload->repository->name;
$messages = array('New commit:');

$commits = array_slice(array_reverse($payload->commits), 0, 3);

foreach ($commits as $commit) {
  $commit_message = truncate($commit->message);
  $messages[] = '+ (' . $commit->author->name . ') ' . $commit_message;
}

$message = implode("\n", $messages);
system('pushnot ' . escapeshellarg($app) . ' ' . escapeshellarg($message));
```

A Wrapper Script
----------------

Since I install node inside `nvm`. It can't be run by `nobody` (web server's PHP process). To make it work I need to use some dirty hack:

__/usr/bin/pushnot__

```bash
#!/bin/bash
export PATH=/root/.nvm/v0.10.22/bin:$PATH
export HOME=/root
echo "sending noti"
/root/.nvm/v0.10.22/bin/pushnot "$@" 2>&1
```

And make sure to give appropriate permissions to `/root` and `/root/.nvm`.
I know it's dirty, but it works for me.
