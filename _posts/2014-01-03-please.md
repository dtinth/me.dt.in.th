title: "please — repeat last command as root."
preamble: |
  Today I'd like to introduce you to this recipe you can put in your `.bashrc`:

  ```bash
  alias please='sudo bash -c "$(history -p !!)"'
  ```
---

---

You probably have had these moments when you are trying to run a command
only to find out that you are not root:

```bash
▹ echo 127.0.0.1 dev.my.test.app.com >> /etc/hosts
-bash: /etc/hosts: Permission denied
```

---

With this alias, you can just re-run the command using

```bash
▹ please
```

and it will re-run the command as root.
Note that _it also works with redirections!_


Handles Arguments Correctly
---------------------------

To see if this recipe works well with complex commands,
consider this example:

```bash
▹ ruby -e 'p [ARGV, `whoami`.strip]' a 'b c' "d e" f `whoami`
[["a", "b c", "d e", "f", "dttvb"], "dttvb"]

▹ please
[["a", "b c", "d e", "f", "root"], "root"]
```

As you can see, the whole command is run
as if it's being typed again, but in the root shell.
