preamble: |
  [Atom 1.0](http://blog.atom.io/2015/06/25/atom-1-0.html) has recently been released.
  It is a very nice text editor that is “hackable to the core.”
  You can change its look and behavior with CSS (Less) and CoffeeScript.

  So I added some subtle 3D effects to the text editor’s tree view and the minimap to make it look more “cool.”
