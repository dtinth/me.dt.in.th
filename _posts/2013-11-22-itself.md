title: The "itself" Recipe
preamble: |
  I'm tired of having to write `function(x) { return x.something }` again
  and again and again and again and again,
  and I'm working on a very small standalone script,
  so using [it.js](https://github.com/dtinth/it.js) seems to be an overkill for me.

  So I came up with a simple recipe:

  ```javascript
  function itself(code) {
    return new Function('its', 'return its' + code)
  }

  var its = itself
  ```
---

Let's see some use cases...

```javascript
;['hello\n', 'world\n', 'test\n'].map(itself('.trim()'))
// => [ 'hello', 'world', 'test' ]
```

An [npm module](https://github.com/dtinth/itself) is available!

```bash
npm install itself
```

That version also has function caching, so it should be extremely fast.
