<p>I was at a computer camp (today I came back to my home but I'll go back to the computer camp for three more days after posting this).</p>

<p>I learned about sorting algorithms (and their efficiency) and we took the pre-test.</p>

<p>I have to explain about sorting algorithms and do some data sorting on paper using various algorithms. I got 15 numbers and the test says that I have to sort these data using Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort and Quick Sort, and I have 45 minutes to do it. I didn't finish it in time, so I have to practicing about sorting on paper.</p>

<p>So I wrote some numbers on the paper, and use my stopwatch to record the time I use to sort it.</p>

<p>But I don't have a stopwatch... So I decided to open the Terminal and do this:</p>

<pre><code>time cat
</code></pre>

<p>The timer start, and when I want to stop, I press Ctrl+D, then it tells the time! :P</p>
