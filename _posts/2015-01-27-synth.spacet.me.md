  I competed in this year’s [Static Showdown](http://staticshowdown.com/). This year I created [a web-based synthesizer](http://2015.staticshowdown.com/teams/spacetme).

  This year’s grand sponsor is the [Polymer project](https://www.polymer-project.org/), with a special prize for Best Use of Web Components, so this event is the best time to experiment with Polymer.

  (Update: [I won that prize.](http://2015.staticshowdown.com/winners))

  This article describes the process of building this application using Polymer, Gulp, Jade, Sass and ES6.
