<p>I was looking for a free GPS tracker to record trips from my school to my university on my iPad.</p>

<p>One that does the simplest things that a GPS tracker can do: record the coordinates and let me get these data out to do stuff with it.</p>

<h2>I Haven't Found Any Which Works for Me</h2>

<p>Many GPS trackers are not free (and has a lot of features I don't really want), or relies heavily on their own server.</p>

<p>I prefer to have full control over my data. I would like to only send them when I want, and have full access to them.</p>

<h2>My Simplest GPS Tracking Webapp</h2>

<p>This is the simplest GPS tracking webapp that works for me.</p>

<p><strong>What it does:</strong> It logs your location and time in localStorage and submits them to any URL when you click "Submit". That's it.</p>

<p>Without much talking, let's <a href="https://github.com/dtinth/gps/blob/gh-pages/index.html">see the code</a> (or <a href="http://dtinth.github.com/gps/">the live version</a>).</p>

<p>It has got no map display, speedometer, or whatever. It just logs your coordinates locally into the textarea and localStorage and submits to the URL specified at the top.</p>

<p>This app won't communicate with the server (the URL specified at the top) unless you click the submit button.</p>

<h2>Usage (for GPS-equipped iDevices)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Turn off "Auto-Lock" in the Settings app (set it to Never). This app won't track your location when your device is off or locked.</li>
<li>Open Safari and navigate to the web app's URL.</li>
<li>Specify the server's URL.</li>
<li>Tap the "Start Tracking" button.</li>
<li>When tracking, no connection to the Internet is needed.</li>
<li>Once finished, tap the "Submit" button to submit them to the server.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Receiving The Log</h2>

<p>My GPS tracker sends the log (contents of the textarea) to the URL specified at the top by using the <code>coords</code> POST variable.</p>

<p>Your script should be able to handle it easily. Here is the script that runs on my server:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php file_put_contents('/path/to/gps.log', $_POST['coords']);
</code></pre>

<h2>Parsing The Log Format</h2>

<p>There are 4 kinds of line. A comment line, a start line, a coordinate line, or the failing line.</p>

<p>A comment line starts with <code>--</code>. Your log parser should ignore these lines. For example:</p>

<pre><code>-- this is a comment
</code></pre>

<p>A start line indicates the time that the user pressed the "Start Tracking" button. The format is <code>[time] // start</code>. For example:</p>

<pre><code>1302263615830 // start
</code></pre>

<p>A coordinate line looks like <code>[time] // [lat] // [lng]</code>. A example of this line:</p>

<pre><code>1302263698765 // 13.797455945576084 // 100.61361547747381
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, a failure line indicates that the tracker wasn't able to track the position at a specified time. For example,</p>

<pre><code>1302263678901 // fail
</code></pre>

<h2>Have Fun With Your Data</h2>

<p>Use it with Google Maps API or whatever. Have fun!</p>
