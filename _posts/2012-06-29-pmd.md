title: "pmd: A Command-Line Pomodoro Timer for Mac"
preamble: |
  Today, I started applying [The Pomodoro Technique](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/), so I
  made for myself a simple countdown timer.
  
  This blog post also covers how to make a NSStatusItem that lives at the far right of the items.
---




As I usually work with the Terminal, this app must be easily usable from the Terminal.
But I also want to always see the time remaining.

The result is [pmd](https://github.com/dtinth/pmd). It is invoked from the command-line, and
displays the remaining time at the status bar, finally, it sends a Growl notification.

The command is written in Shell Script, with the countdown timer written in MacRuby.

---------

To use, just invoke from the terminal:

    pmd start

Then the countdown will show.

Making a Status Bar Item Go Far Right
-------------------------------------

Originally, I wrote the countdown in Objective-C and working with it feels like an overkill.
There is an Xcode project file, a `main.m`, the app delegate stuff (`.m` and `.h`), a `.xib` file,
and finally an .app file.
So I rewrote it in [42 lines of MacRuby](https://github.com/dtinth/pmd/blob/master/pmd-counter).
The code shown here will be from the Objective-C version though.

Usually, when running a status bar application, the new status bar item gets added
__to the left__ of the status bar.

To make it go to far right, we must use [Cocoa's private API](http://cocoadev.com/wiki/NSStatusItem).

    statusItem = [[NSStatusBar systemStatusBar] _statusItemWithLength:0.0 withPriority:INT_MAX];

But the length parameter is not used when doing it this way, so after creating the item, we
need to set its length.

    [statusItem setLength:NSVariableStatusItemLength];
