<p>(Updated: I changed the link to point to a newer version on GitHub, which also supports groups and negation).</p>

<p>On Facebook, I try to keep all my friends arranged inside at least one list.</p>

<p>But when I add new friends, I usually forget to put them inside a list. I lost them, because I found no easy way to find all the friends that are not in any lists.</p>

<p>That is why I made this:</p>

<p><a href="http://dtinth.github.com/friendlist/">http://dtinth.github.com/friendlist/</a></p>

<p>It is a JavaScript application with no server side stuff and this is my first time using Facebook's API.</p>

<p>This tool helps you find them (friends not in any lists) and helps you put them in the right list. This tool can also suggest the list based on their mutual friends with you.</p>

<p>This tool works best when you don't have too much friends, because this tool fetches all of your friends and friend lists at start time. If you have too much of them, not all of them will be fetched and there will be problems. It works fine for me, but I can't guarantee that it will work for everyone.</p>

<p>Works best in Firefox. Untested in other browsers.</p>
