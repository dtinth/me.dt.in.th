I'm giving my friend a JavaScript and Node.js crash course through Skype, using [ttycast](/page/ttycast)
to stream my live terminal session through to friend.

After teaching, I talked to him about what Terminal apps can do, such as:

* Using `find` to convert all .wav files in current and subdirectory to .ogg file and delete the original wav files.
* Using `brew` to quickly install software.
* Browsing the web with `elinks`.
* Chatting on Facebook using `finch`.
* Playing music using `mplayer` (he hears it through Skype)

And finally, playing movies on a Terminal!

First, rebuild mplayer with libcaca.

    brew unlink mplayer
    brew uninstall mplayer
    brew install libcaca
    brew install mplayer

And then, stream the movie ([thanks to this post](http://oreilly.com/pub/h/4441))

    CACA_DRIVER=ncurses mplayer \
        -vf framestep=10 -vo caca -quiet \
        sintel-2048-surround.mp4

`-vf framestep=10` tells mplayer to update every 10 frames so the movie doesn't flicker too much.
`-vo caca` tells mplayer to output as a colored ASCII art.
Finally, `-quiet` tells mplayer not to display the current playing stats every frame, which interferes with the
terminal output.

Last but not least, I opened up VLC and streamed from iSight through network, and then told mplayer to stream from it:
