  > You shouldn’t organise CSS by splitting it into separate files any more than you should organise a pane of glass by dropping it on a concrete floor.

  An alternative to not splitting your CSS into multiple files, is to learn how to properly organize your CSS in multiple files. When done properly, this brings many advantages:

  - Your CSS files will be small and easy to navigate. No need to scroll up and down, and your text editor will love you.
  - Your CSS files will be more modular.
  - Your CSS selectors won’t cascade or conflict with other selectors.
  - Your style will be more predictable, even though you can’t predict which file gets included first.
