<p>My friends wanted my help. There is a locked forum topic that will open for reply in the next 20 minutes. He needs to reply on that topic as soon as it is available.</p>

<p>I used this script.</p>

<pre>#!/bin/bash
URL='<strong>the url you want to monitor</strong>'
MATCH='<strong>the text that if match, means that the topic is still locked</strong>'
while true; do
    if (curl "$URL" | grep "$MATCH"); then
        echo '!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!~ Not Yet'
    else
        echo '!!%$$%!%$#@$%#$%@%$%$!#%$!%%^!%^@%^!%^@!! NOW!'
    fi
    sleep 60
done</pre>

<p>So this bash script just periodically checks that page until the match is not found.</p>

<p>The reason why I need to make a bash script is because I forgot to install the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/115" target="_blank">ReloadEvery extension</a> for Firefox.</p>
