  I recently gave a talk at [Code Mania 10](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/code-mania-10-tickets-17379863640),
  organized by Thai Programmer Network.

  This talk was about frontend web development in 2015.
  I briefly gave an overview of new web technologies from the past four years, and gave an example of a web development workflow using ES6, React and Webpack.
