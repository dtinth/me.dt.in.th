<p>I put some stuff on my GitHub profile, but did not mention it on this blog.</p>

<p>You can take a look: <a href="https://github.com/dtinth">https://github.com/dtinth</a></p>

<p>I also moved several old projects to GitHub:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dtinth/oauthdamnit">oauthdamnit</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dtinth/DtBMS">DtBMS</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This month, I'm staying at a computer camp, so I might not blog much.</p>
