<pre>I hate writing poems
I hate writing rhymes
Wanna know what's the problem?
That's because I don't have time!</pre>

On play cards
That's why I came up with this shit
Don't know where to start</pre>

<p>Finally, the staff adds in the final line:</p>

<pre>I'm singing but I've got no crowds.</pre>
