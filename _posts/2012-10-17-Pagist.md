title: "Pagist â€” Turn a Gist Into a Web Page"
preamble: |
  Tomorrow I'm going to have a discrete maths test,
  and so there are few friends asking me several questions.
  
  So I think, _wouldn't it be nice if there is a way to send them
  these mathematical equations (or few paragraph of text) in a way that is
  as easy as posting a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/)?_
  
  That's why I created [__Pagist__](http://pagist.github.com/).

Basically, pagist lets you write some text documents in Markdown format,
submit it to Gist, and alter the URL from `https://gist.github.com` to `http://pagist.github.com`.

Then Pagist will fetch the Gist, format the contents with Markdown, and apply Mathjax. Here's how it looks like:

The good thing is that Gists are editble, so I can just edit the Gist and when I refresh
the page, I can see new content. [Here's an example of a Pagist](http://pagist.github.com/?3899155),
which is generated from [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/3899155).

Pagist also allows raw HTML, CSS and JavaScript. So you can make dynamic pages quickly from Pagist.
