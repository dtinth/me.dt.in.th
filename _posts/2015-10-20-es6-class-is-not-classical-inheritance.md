  I’ve read several articles by [Eric Elliott](https://medium.com/u/c359511de780)
  on JavaScript, such as [10 Interview Questions Every JavaScript Developer Should Know](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/10-interview-questions-every-javascript-developer-should-know-6fa6bdf5ad95) and [The Two Pillars of JavaScript](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-two-pillars-of-javascript-ee6f3281e7f3).

  He emphasizes that classical inheritance is dangerous and should not be used (which I agree),
  but somehow, the `class` syntax also gets the blame.
  In fact, it seems to me that the terms _classical inheritance_, `class`,
  and ES6 class were used _interchangeably_.

  And that is totally wrong.
