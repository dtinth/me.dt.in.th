<p><strong>I'm not making a new Twitter client, or a Twitter service. I am not making an app for users to use. I just want to call the API with my account!</strong></p>

<p>I think OAuth is complicated in some situations, especially when you want to do something very simple, e.g. posting a status update from your own account. </p>

<p>Before Twitter killed basic authentication, it was as simple as a single line curl command, but now, it's a lot more complicated.</p>

<h2>Introducing OAuth Damnit</h2>

<p>So let me introduce <strong>OAuth Damnit</strong>, a super simple Twitter OAuth library for PHP. This library is for you if:</p>

<ul>
<li>You just want to make a simple PHP script that calls the Twitter API using your account.</li>
<li>You are not planning to let other users to sign in with your application.</li>
<li>You want to parse the response yourself.</li>
</ul>

<p>This library is a very simple implementation of OAuth. It's only job is -- given the consumer key, consumer secret, access token, access token secret, and a GET/POST request to an OAuth service -- to sign the request, send the request to the server, and then pass the response from the server back.</p>

<p>I coded it based on <a href="http://github.com/abraham/twitteroauth">abraham's twitteroauth</a> project. Did not really copy any code from there, I just look at it to figure out how the OAuth process works.</p>

<h2>Get OAuth Damnit</h2>

<p><strong>Get <a href="https://github.com/dtinth/oauthdamnit"><code>oauthdamnit.php</code> here</a>.</strong></p>

<h2>Registering an Application for Your Account</h2>

<p>To make OAuth calls as an authenticated user, you will need a consumer key + secret and an access token + secret. To get that you will need to register a Twitter application.</p>

<p>First of all, you will want to create an application for yourself. Sign in with the Twitter account you want to use your application with, then go to <a href="http://dev.twitter.com/apps/new">http://dev.twitter.com/apps/new</a> and register a new application.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Application Name</strong> is what people will see as the source of the tweet. On Twitter it will show as "less than 20 seconds ago via <em>your application name</em>"</li>
<li><strong>Application Website:</strong> Put in your website address, so that when people click on your application's link, they will go to your website.</li>
<li><strong>Application Type:</strong> Client.</li>
<li><strong>Access Type:</strong> Read &amp; Write.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting the Keys, Secrets and Tokens</h2>

<p>After you register your application, you will be taken to your application's details page. Take note of your application's:</p>

<ul>
<li>Consumer key</li>
<li>Consumer secret</li>
</ul>

<p>Now on the right side, click the navigation link that says "My Access Token". Then take note of your:</p>

<ul>
<li>Access token</li>
<li>Access token secret</li>
</ul>

<p>Then make a new file to hold your key, token, and your secrets. Let's name it <code>config.php</code>.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/615127.js?file=config.php"></script>

<h2>Using OAuth Damnit</h2>

<p>How to use it? Simple!</p>

<p>To create a new instance of the API object, you just:</p>

<pre><code>$api = new OAuthDamnit(CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET, ACCESS_TOKEN, ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET);
</code></pre>

<p>To GET something from the Twitter API:</p>

<pre><code>$raw = $api-&gt;get($url, $params);
</code></pre>

<p>To POST something to the Twitter API:</p>

<pre><code>$raw = $api-&gt;post($url, $params);
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>$url</code> is the <strong>absolute URL</strong> to Twitter's API endpoint and <code>$params</code> is an array of parameters to send to Twitter API.</p>

<p>These 2 functions returns the <strong>raw response</strong> from Twitter's API and has not been processed in anyway. It's now up to you to do whatever you need to do with it.</p>

<h2>An Example</h2>

<p>This example calls <code>verify_credentials</code> method, parses it and displays the output.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/615127.js?file=test.php"></script>

<p>An example of a POST request:</p>

<pre><code>$raw = $api-&gt;post('http://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/update.json', array('status' =&gt; 'Testin it again!'));
</code></pre>

<h2>That's It</h2>

<p>Oh and if my library somehow doesn't work (it worked for me), please try to fix it and send me a correction. Thanks!</p>
