<p>I have been chatting with a random guy, in Thai language. The following chat transcription is translated (and is slightly modified).</p>

<p>First, it was a normal chat. And then he starts out: <em>I am a hacker, white hat hacker. I use my skill to fix others' computer problems without them knowing it.</em> I think like... really? Let me check if you really are one.</p>

<p>So first, let me ask you some basic question first.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; What Windows are you using?
&lt; No, not Windows. It's a specialized system for hacking.
</code></pre>

<p>So I guess he must be a Linux user. What else could it be? Mac? <del>Specialized for hacking? No way.</del></p>

<pre><code>&gt; So do you know what version of Windows I'm using?
&lt; Either Windows XP or Windows 7
  So do you use XP?
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, if one does not use Windows XP, they will probably use Windows 7. Vista sucks.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; No.
</code></pre>

<p>Again, it's 50% chance, and he has failed.</p>

<pre><code>&lt; So it must be Windows 7.
&gt; Obviously, but why can't you get it right at the first place?
&lt; It's really hard to see. I have to dig through millions of number.
  However, I can get the right answer if I want it.
  But hey, Windows 7 is a very good operating system—
  it offers good protection!
</code></pre>

<p>I already knew about the protection thing of Windows 7, but millions of number? Windows XP is 5.1, and Windows 7 is 6.1. Just look at this damn string, is it so hard to figure out?</p>

<pre><code>&gt; Do you know my IP?
&lt; It will take a long time. There are billions of IP.....
</code></pre>

<p>While I chat with that guy, I made a page that just redirects the viewer to a Wikipedia article about TCP/IP, and gave that link to him, shortened using bit.ly.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; Well, I suggest that you read about this: http://bit.ly/.....
  You should learn about TCP/IP.
</code></pre>

<p>He clicked on it. His IP address and user agent string is recorded on the server's log. It shows that he is using Windows XP, and not any kind of a specialized operating system.</p>

<p>We continued chatting for a while, then I decided to surprise him a bit.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; I will tell you something. Your IP is 124.122.___.___.
</code></pre>

<p>But that guy keeps <span style="cursor:help;border-bottom:1px dotted #aaa" title="แถ">"tae"</span>ing.</p>

<pre><code>&lt; Hahaha, that was my fake IP.
&gt; Yeah, but I can tell your "fake IP" in seconds.
  So what's your real IP?
</code></pre>

<p>I think that the IP I found is already a real IP. If it's not then he must be using a proxy server.</p>

<p>But the next thing shocked me.</p>

<pre><code>&lt; I'm not gonna tell you my real IP. But here's a hint:
  My IP starts with 192.16
</code></pre>

<p>What the fuck.</p>

<pre><code>&lt; And that IP address was the IP address of my server. I put it at Korea.
</code></pre>

<p>That IP address comes from Thailand. Everyone knows it.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; Let me tell you something. 124.122.___.___ is a Thailand IP address and not Korea. You're also using True Internet.
&lt; But the server is really at Korea.
</code></pre>

<p>I then completely ignored this guy.</p>

<p>That was just for fun. I hope that he didn't take it too seriously. Heheh.</p>
